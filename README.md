# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset and provides accurate predictions to assist in early diagnosis.

## Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess medical dataset
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Predict heart disease risk based on input features

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation

## Results
The trained model achieved good accuracy and demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in medical prediction tasks.

## Skills Gained
- Data preprocessing
- Machine learning model development
- Data visualization
- Model evaluation
